# get_next_line
42 get_next_line
## Introduction
The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.
## Discription
* Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to get_next_line() function lets you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
* the function returns the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it returns NULL.
* the returned line should include the terminating \n character, except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.
* the helper functions needed in the get_next_line_utils.c file.
## Compile
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c

* get_next_line() has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas read() didnâ€™t reach the end of file, also it has an undefined behavior when reading a binary file.
